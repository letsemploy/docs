# Why

Let's look at three topics regarding job postings:

- Costs
- Convenience
- Efficiency

## Costs

Publishing and finding jobs is a huge market. Nowadays there are **hundrets or thousands** of job portals, job boards and career platforms world wide.

An estimated **USD 34.4 billion** is spent annually on online job advertisements.

This figure for 2023 underscores the immense importance of online job boards and career platforms in modern human resources management. These figures come from Staffing Industry Analysts (SIA), a leading analysis firm in the field of human resources management.

Needless to say, job portals typically **charge employers regardless** of whether they fill the position or not.

We believe that a publishing job offerings is rediculous expensive, it should be **free of charge**.

## Convenience

Publishing a job on **multiple portals** often means to *copy/paste* data and **more work to publish and manage**. 

Employers must decide on which of the many job portals they want to publish their job vacancies. An account must be created on each platform and all data must be entered separately into each of these portals.

We find this process unnecessary and impractical - as an employer, we want to advertise the position in **one place** and **distribute** the information - on our own website.

We think, our solution might be the missing piece to make it work.

## Efficiency

Finding job postings online in the web is unnecessarily difficult due to unstructured data.

While there has been some attempts to address this using a job posting schema for jobs, which even Google supports ([Why a new Format](faq.md#why-a-new-format)), it hasn't been widely adopted and **still forces search engines to crawl entire websites** just to find the relevant page. This is like searching an entire library for a single page of a book.

We propose a much simpler approach, **inspired by conventions** like _robots.txt_ or _sitemap.xml_. Companies would place all their job listings in a structured file at a single, well-known URL.

Job search engines and aggregators would only need to check this one location to get all the data they need. This would make discovering and indexing job postings vastly more efficient for everyone.
