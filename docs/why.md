# What is the Issue?

## Expensive

> How much will it cost? Can my company afford that?

Publishing and finding jobs is a huge market. 

Nowadays there are **hundrets or thousands** of job portals world wide:

Just to name a few: [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com), [Monster](https://www.monster.com), [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com), [CareerBuilder](https://www.careerbuilder.com), [ZipRecruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com), [Jobrapido](https://de.jobrapido.com), [Simply Hired](https://www.simplyhired.com), [Dice](https://www.dice.com), [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com), [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com), [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com), [FlexJobs](https://www.flexjobs.com), [Adzuna](https://www.adzuna.com), [StepStone](https://www.stepstone.de), [XING](https://www.xing.com), [Stellenanzeigen.de](https://www.stellenanzeigen.de), [Jobware](https://www.jobware.de), [Meinestadt.de](https://www.meinestadt.de), [Absolventa](https://www.absolventa.de), [Kimeta](https://www.kimeta.de), [JobNinja](https://www.jobninja.com), [Jobs.ch](https://www.jobs.ch), [JobScout24.ch](https://www.jobscout24.ch), [JobUp.ch](https://www.jobup.ch), [Karriere.at](https://www.karriere.at), a.s.o

Getting information about how much the market is or their profits are difficult but we got an example from Switzerland, JobCloud Inc., the leading job portal in Switzerland with a press release in 2019:

    ...2018 was a particularly successful year â€“ JobCloud recorded record sales of CHF 115 million (USD 117 million).

Employers in Switzerland paid more than **USD 100 millions per year** just to publish their job openings **to one single job portal**.

Needless to say, job portals typically **charge employeers regardless** of whether they fill the position or not. 

## Inefficient 

### Employers

> On which job portals should employers publish job openings?

Employers must decide on which of the many, many job portals to publish our job openings. 

It is **not obvious to find the criteria** to decide on which portal they have the best chances to find a candidate.

Publishing a job on **multiple portals** often means to copy/paste data and **more work to publish and manage**.

As an employer, we want to publish the job on **one location** and **spread** the info.

### Job Seekers

> Where to look for a new job? On which job portals? Or should I search the web?

If an employer **can't afford** to pay for a job posting, they might only list the vacancy **somewhere on their own website**. Further, all Google/Bing indexed job openings are often **outdated** because they do or can not distingues normal website content from job openings.

We think, our solution might be the **missing piece to make it work**.
