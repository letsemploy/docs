# What is the Issue?

## Expensive

> How much will it cost to publish my job opening? Can my company afford that?

Publishing and finding jobs is a huge market. Nowadays there are **hundrets or thousands** of job portals, job boards and career platforms world wide. 

An estimated **34.4 USD billion** is spent annually on online job advertisements. This figure for 2023 underscores the immense importance of online job boards and career platforms in modern human resources management. The market for online job ads is a central component of the global recruiting industry. These figures come from Staffing Industry Analysts (SIA), a leading analysis firm in the field of human resources management.

Needless to say, job portals typically **charge employers regardless** of whether they fill the position or not.

## Inefficient 

### Employers

> On which job portals should employers publish job openings?

Employers must decide on which of the many, many job portals to publish our job openings. 

It is **not obvious to find the criteria** to decide on which portal they have the best chances to find a candidate.

Publishing a job on **multiple portals** often means to copy/paste data and **more work to publish and manage**.

As an employer, we want to publish the job on **one location** and **spread** the info.

### Job Seekers

> Where to look for a new job? On which job portals? Or should I search the web?

If an employer **can't afford** to pay for a job posting, they might only list the vacancy **somewhere on their own website**. Further, all Google/Bing indexed job openings are often **outdated** because they do or can not distingues normal website content from job openings.

We think, our solution might be the **missing piece to make it work**.
