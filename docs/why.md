> How much will it cost? Can my company afford that?

Publishing and finding jobs is a huge market. 

Nowadays there are **hundrets or thousands** of job portals world wide:

Just to name a few: [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com), [Monster](https://www.monster.com), [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com), [CareerBuilder](https://www.careerbuilder.com), [ZipRecruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com), [Jobrapido](https://de.jobrapido.com), [Simply Hired](https://www.simplyhired.com), [Dice](https://www.dice.com), [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com), [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com), [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com), [FlexJobs](https://www.flexjobs.com), [Adzuna](https://www.adzuna.com), [StepStone](https://www.stepstone.de), [XING](https://www.xing.com), [Stellenanzeigen.de](https://www.stellenanzeigen.de), [Jobbörse der Bundesagentur für Arbeit](https://www.arbeitsagentur.de/jobsuche), [Jobware](https://www.jobware.de), [Meinestadt.de](https://www.meinestadt.de), [Absolventa](https://www.absolventa.de), [Kimeta](https://www.kimeta.de), [JobNinja](https://www.jobninja.com), [Jobs.ch](https://www.jobs.ch), [JobScout24.ch](https://www.jobscout24.ch), [JobUp.ch](https://www.jobup.ch), [Karriere.at](https://www.karriere.at), ...

Getting information about how much the market is or their profits are difficult but we got an example from Switzerland, JobCloud Inc., the leading job portal in Switzerland with a press release in 2018:

!!! quote
    ...This enabled us to break through the CHF 100 million barrier for the first time in 2017: JobCloud generated sales of CHF 106 million (USD ~108 million), representing growth of 11 percent. Every day, over 160,000 job seekers visited Switzerland's two best-known job portals, jobs.ch and jobup.ch, generating over 12 million job views per month. The number of jobs, especially in the SME segment, grew by 7 and 15 percent respectively. In 2017, we also created 15 new jobs and currently employ around 200 people.

This means, **companies in Switzerland paid more than USD 100 millions** (!) just to publish their job openings to one job portal.

!!! note
    As a reference: In 2017, the total number of employed persons in Switzerland was 5.01 million ([Source](https://www.swissstats.bfs.admin.ch/collection/ch.admin.bfs.swissstat.en.issue18000251800/article/issue18000251800-06))

Needless to say, job portals typically **charge you regardless** of whether you fill the position or not. 

## Inefficient 

### Employers

> On which job portals should I publish my job openings?

As an employer we must decide where to publish our job openings. It is not easy to find the criteria to decide on which portal we have the best chances to find a candidate. Publishing a job on multiple portals often means to copy/paste data and more work to manage.

We want to publish the job on **one location** and **spread** the info.

### Job Seekers

> Where to look for a new job? On which job portals? Or should I search the web?

If an employer **can't afford** to pay for a job posting, they might only list the vacancy **somewhere on their own website**. Further, all Google/Bing indexed job openings are often **outdated** because they do not distingues normal website content from job openings.

We think, our solution might be the **missing piece to make this work**.
