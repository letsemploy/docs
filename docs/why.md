# What is the issue?

## Expensive and inefficient

Publishing and finding jobs is a huge market. 

Nowadays there are **hundrets or thousands** of job portals world wide:

Just to name a few: [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com), [Monster](https://www.monster.com), [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com), [CareerBuilder](https://www.careerbuilder.com), [ZipRecruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com), [Jobrapido](https://de.jobrapido.com), [Simply Hired](https://www.simplyhired.com), [Dice](https://www.dice.com), [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com), [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com), [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com), [FlexJobs](https://www.flexjobs.com), [Adzuna](https://www.adzuna.com), [StepStone](https://www.stepstone.de), [XING](https://www.xing.com), [Stellenanzeigen.de](https://www.stellenanzeigen.de), [Jobbörse der Bundesagentur für Arbeit](https://www.arbeitsagentur.de/jobsuche), [Jobware](https://www.jobware.de), [Meinestadt.de](https://www.meinestadt.de), [Absolventa](https://www.absolventa.de), [Kimeta](https://www.kimeta.de), [JobNinja](https://www.jobninja.com), [Jobs.ch](https://www.jobs.ch), [JobScout24.ch](https://www.jobscout24.ch), [JobUp.ch](https://www.jobup.ch), [Karriere.at](https://www.karriere.at), ...

Getting information about how much the market is or their profits are difficult but we got an example from Switzerland, JobCloud Inc., the leading job portal in Switzerland with a press release in 2018:

> ...This enabled us to break through the CHF 100 million barrier for the first time in 2017: JobCloud generated sales of CHF 106 million (USD ~108 million), representing growth of 11 percent. Every day, over 160,000 job seekers visited Switzerland's two best-known job portals, jobs.ch and jobup.ch, generating over 12 million job views per month. The number of jobs, especially in the SME segment, grew by 7 and 15 percent respectively. In 2017, we also created 15 new jobs and currently employ around 200 people.

As a reference: In 2017, the total number of employed persons in Switzerland was 5.01 million ([Source](https://www.swissstats.bfs.admin.ch/collection/ch.admin.bfs.swissstat.en.issue18000251800/article/issue18000251800-06))

This means, **companies in Switzerland paid more than USD 100 millions** (!) just to publish their job openings to one job portal.

These job portals profit from companies searching for employees that much, they have **no interest at all** in actually making it easier, simpler and more efficient to get a job!

## Where to publish?

As an employer, this raises two questions: 

> 1. On which job portal should I publish my job openings?
> 2. How much will it cost? Can my company afford that?

Needless to say, job portals typically **charge you regardless** of whether you fill the position or not. 

## Where to look for a job?

As a job seeker, you may ask:

> Where to look for a new job? On which job portals? Or should I search the web?

If an employer **can't afford** to pay for a job posting, they might only list the vacancy **somewhere on their own website**, which can be hard to impossible for a candidate to find. 

Further, all Google indexed job openings are often **outdated** because Google does not distingues normal website content from job openings.
