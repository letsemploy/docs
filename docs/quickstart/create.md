# Create the data format

Create an [ojobpub.json](../ojobpub/index.md).

We know, writing JSON manually is not fun. While we used a static ojobpub.json file to demonstrate the simplest way to provide the data, this endpoint is not limited to a static file. It could just as easily be served by a dynamic application or script. In fact, we are working on a tool which will allow to publish oJobPub like a breeze. But for the moment, it is up to you how to write it.

To ensure your ojobpub.json's data is valid, we provide a [oJobPub JSON schema](https://github.com/letsemploy/schema) and a validator app [validator.letsemploy.org](https://validator.letsemploy.org) for manual validation.
