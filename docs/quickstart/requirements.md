# Requirements: Website and Domain

You need **your own domain and website**: e.g. domain example.com.

Publish your full description of your job openings in a web page (HTML) as one usually do. This can be using tools like a:

- CMS (Wordpress, Drupal, etc.)
- Static site generator (Hugo)
- Plain HTML

Important is, that the full job description is accessible using a hyper link, e.g. https://www.example.com/career/job-product-manager.html.

This link will later be used in our data format.
