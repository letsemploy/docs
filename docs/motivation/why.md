# Why: Motivation for Improvement

## Costs and Benefits

Publishing and finding jobs is a huge market. Nowadays there are **hundrets or thousands** of job portals, job boards and career platforms world wide.

An estimated **USD 34.4 billion** is spent annually (2023) on online job advertisements. These figures come from Staffing Industry Analysts (SIA), a leading analysis firm in the field of human resources management.

Needless to say, job portals typically **charge employers regardless** of whether they fill the position or not.

We believe that a publishing job offerings is rediculous expensive, it should be **free of charge**.

## Convenience and Effort

For employers, advertising a job vacancy means choosing a job portal, creating an account, and providing the job portal with the relevant data.

If you want to advertise the same job on another job portal, the effort involved doubles. Why is that? Why can't you just publish the job on our website? The reason is simple: **it won't be found**.

We think, our solution might be the **missing piece to make your jobs found** on your website.

As an employer, we want to advertise our positions in **one place**, on our own website, and **distribute** the information.

## Efficiency and Convetion

Finding job postings online in the web is unnecessarily difficult due to unstructured data.

While there has been some attempts to address this using a job posting schema for jobs, it hasn't been widely adopted and **still forces search engines to crawl entire websites** just to find the relevant page. This is like searching an entire library for a single page of a book.

We propose a much, much simpler approach, **inspired by conventions** like _robots.txt_ or _sitemap.xml_. Employers would place all their job listings in a structured file at a single, well-known URL on their web hosting.

Job search engines and aggregators would only need to check this single path per domain to get all the data they need. This makes discovering and indexing job postings vastly more efficient for everyone.
