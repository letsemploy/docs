## Why a new format? 

There are already existing formats for job ads, the most promising of which [job-posting JSON Schema](https://schema.org/JobPosting) seems also be supported by Google [^1]. 

However, a bot must crawl the entire website to find the job ads and it is bloated with data. For us, this format seems to be most useful for larger search bots such as Google. oJobPub does not restrict you from using this format on your job description website as well; it complements it.

There is also another schema: [*json-job*](http://lukasz-madon.github.io/json-job/). It is somewhat more comprehensive and the project has not been active for over 10 years. It does not define where this data should be placed on your website. We could have used it, but we didn't want to wake sleeping daemons.
