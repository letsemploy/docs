# About oJobPub.json

oJobPub is our minimalistic data file in JSON ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)), containing meta infos about your job openings.

It must be placed in a defined path in your web hosting: `<yourdomain.tld>/.well-known/ojobpub.json`.

## oJobPub Format

In the following sample, we see first an `employer` object containing infos about the company: *name*, *location*, *industry*, (main website) *url*.

Later we find a list of jobs. There is only one job in the sample but there is currently no limit how many job entries you add.

1. The `employer` json object with minimal information about the employer.
2. The list of `jobs` objects with meta information about the job openings.


!!! note
    JSON might look complicated if you're not familiar with it, but don't worry â€” you won't have to write it by hand. Once this format is finalized, we'll provide tools to help you generate and validate the structure.

Some of the (blue) keys (e.g. `workload` or `description`) are optional while others are required (e.g. `title`).

This is why we provide a [oJobPub JSON Schema](ojobpub-schema.md) (also see [GitHub](https://github.com/letsemploy/schema)) and an online validator tool [validator.letsemploy.org](https://validator.letsemploy.org) to allow verification of the data structure.

!!! tip
    While not all properties are required for a valid file, we highly recommend you fill out as much metadata as possible.
