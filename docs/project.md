# About the Project

To establish a JSON schema as a standard format for publishing vacancies we follow the following strategy:

## 1. **Define a Governance Model**

First, we need to decide who will be in charge of maintaining the standard. This could be a non-profit organization, a consortium of industry players, or an open-source community. A clear governance model ensures the standard evolves transparently and in a way that benefits everyone.

* **Create a Core Team:** Assemble a small group of stakeholders, including recruiters, developers, and job board operators, to guide the initial development.
* **Establish a Decision-Making Process:** Determine how changes to the schema will be proposed, discussed, and approved. This could be a formal voting process or a consensus-based approach.

## 2. **Build a Community**

A standard is only useful if it's widely adopted. This requires active engagement with the community.

* **Publish the Schema:** Make the schema publicly available on a platform like GitHub. Use a versioning system (e.g., `v1`, `v2`) to manage changes.
* **Create Documentation:** Write clear and comprehensive documentation. Explain what each field is for, provide examples, and offer guidance on how to implement the schema.
* **Launch a Website or Forum:** Create a dedicated space for discussion, bug reports, and feature requests. This is where you'll gather feedback and build momentum.
* **Engage with Key Stakeholders:** Reach out to stakeholders. Show them the benefits of the standard and encourage them to participate.

## 3. **Formalize the Standard**

Once the schema is mature and has received sufficient community feedback, you can pursue formal recognition.

* **Write a Specification:** Turn the schema and its documentation into a formal specification document. This should include a detailed description of every field, data types, and any business rules.

## 4. **Promote Adoption and Provide Tools**

Promotion is key to making the standard a success.

* **Develop Client Libraries:** Create official libraries in popular programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript) to make it easy for developers to use the schema.
* **Build Validation Tools:** Offer a free online tool where anyone can paste their JSON and validate it against the schema. This helps catch errors and encourages correct usage.
* **Showcase Success Stories:** As companies start to adopt the standard, highlight their success. This provides social proof and demonstrates the real-world value of the format.
* **Maintain and Iterate:** Continue to solicit feedback and release new versions of the schema as the industry evolves.
