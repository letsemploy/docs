# Our Solution

## Use your own Website

So, we ask ourselves:

> Why do we even need to post job openings on commercial portals?!

Actually, we don't! 

The **World Wide Web** is a vast, **distributed database** where websites are stored all over the globe, not on a single, centralized platform. 

## Structured Data

Because there's **no standard format** (yet) for published job data on websites, job information can vary widely â€” from a simple list of jobs to a searchable input field to query jobs to an individual pages for each opening. 

This lack of consistency and structure **makes it difficult for search engines** to accurately recognize the context as job openings.

While we still **want to keep our content** on our own website rather than on commercial platforms that sell our data, the challenge is **making that content discoverable**.

A simplistic, minimalistic, structured data file containing **meta information** about your job opening and a **link to your detailed job page** should be good enough!

## Predefined Path

> How can this data be found?

By placing a metadata file at a **specific**, **predetermined path**, we can ensure that search engines looking for job openings **know exactly where to find the data**. 

This means they are aware of the data's context, allowing them to optimize how often they revisit to update their index.

As a result, job openings can be indexed by **multiple search engines** without further efforts and without any additional cost.

## Keep the Control

> Why use metadata instead of full job descriptions?

The metadata you provide will be stored as an index by search engines, we can't control how long they keep that data.

That is why **only as much information as necessary** is provided. This strategy ensures that there is just enough information to pique a candidate's interest and **send them to the employer's website**. 

This is crucial because employers keep **control of the application process**.
