# Our solution

## Use your own website

So, we ask ourselves:

> Why do we even need to post job openings on commercial portals?!

Actually, we don't! 

The **World Wide Web** is a vast, **distributed database** where websites are stored all over the globe, not on a single, centralized platform. 

Because there's no standard format for how jobs are published on these sites, job information can vary widely â€” from a simple list to a searchable input field to an individual page for each opening. 

This lack of consistency makes it difficult for search engines to accurately recognize and index job openings.

While we still want to keep our content on our own platforms rather than on commercial ones that sell our data, the challenge is making that content discoverable.

## Structured data

> How can we improve to make it easier for search enginess to index our job openings?

A simplistic, minimalistic, structured data file containing **meta** information about your job opening and a **link to your detailed job page** should be good enough!

## Predefined path

> How can this data be found?

By placing a metadata file at a specific, predetermined path, we can ensure that search engines looking for job openings know exactly where to find the data. This means they are aware of the data's content, allowing them to optimize how often they revisit your site based on this data.

As a result, your job openings can be indexed by multiple search engines and job portals without any additional cost to you.

## Keep the control

> Why use metadata instead of full job descriptions?

The metadata you provide will be indexed and stored by search engines, you can't control how long they keep that data.

That is why **we only provide as much information as necessary** to guide candidates to **your own website**. By directing them to your website, you **retain control** over the application process and can provide more detailed information there.

This strategy ensures that you provide just enough information to pique a candidate's interest and **send them to your website**. This is crucial because you are in **control of the application process** there, giving you the final say on who can apply and what further details they see.
