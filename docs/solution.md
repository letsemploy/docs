# Our solution

## Use your own website

So, we ask ourselves:

> Why do we even need to post job openings on commercial portals?!

Actually, we don't! 

There is this thing called **world wide web**, right? A huge **distributed database** across the globe. 

Since the early days, websites are build and stored all over the internet and then some smart guys made a site to let us search the web.

We still want this! We don't want to manage our content on commercial platforms selling our data.

## Structured data

> How can we improve to make it easier for search enginess to index our job openings?

A simplistic, minimalistic, structured data file containing **meta** information about your job posting and a **link to your detailed job website** should be enough!

## Predefined path

> How can this data be found?

We place the metadata file at a **defined path**.

Search engines looking for job openings know beforehand where to look for the data. 

The search engines are **aware what this data is about**, can optimize revisits and indexing.

Further, your jop openings can be indexed by many search engines or job portals **without additional costs for you**.

## Keep the control

> Why only metadata and not the all detailed job information?

The metadata will be indexed and stored by the search engines some time. Nobody can and want to control that.

That is why **you only give as much information as needed** and guide the condidates to **your own website** where **you control the process** for applicatoin and more detailed information.
