# About Let's Employ

"Let's Employ" is an initiative with the following goals:

Create a free, simple and convenient process to publish and find your vacancies on your own website. Make it simple and efficient for everyone to collect the data with help of a standardised job meta data format [_ojobpub.json_](./implementation/ojobpub-format.md).

## Benfits

- [x] **Simple**: Employers manage open job positions on their websites.
- [x] **Efficient**: Search engines collect structured data from a known path on employers' web servers.
- [x] **Keep Control**: Employers keep control of their data and application process.
- [x] **Free**: No additional costs beyond what employers already pay for your domain and web hosting.

## How does it work?

- Companies and Employeers publish their jobs on their own website, on a specific path, in a specific format.
- Job search engines (read "everyone") can gather these data regularly and import them into their search index.
